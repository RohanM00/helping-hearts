# Project - Helping Hearts â™¥

This project creates a platform where hospitals can create their accounts and fill up their information related to address, number of beds, ventilators, do they need some help from other coworkers or doctors/nurses, do they need some ventilators, etc.  

The patients from their account will then be able to see the list of hospitals with their count of remaining beds, ventilators, oxygen beds, corona positive patients count, etc. and accordingly will be able to send request to get admitted in particular hospital.  
Then the corresponding hospital will be able to see the list of patients request which will be filtered according to the CT Scan score of the patient which they had given while submitting a request.

The Ventilator Provider can also create their account and set their information like whether they currently have any ventilators to give and how much do they have, so that the hospital users will be able to see the ventilator providers list to get in touch with them.  

Anyone who wish to do the other stuff related to documents in hospital (if it is the case), then they can create their Co-Worker Account and go through list of hospitals who needs Co-Workers right now to apply.

If you are a doctor or retired doctor then by creating Doctor Account you will be able to fulfill the Hospital's request of needing extra doctors for their operations by applying for it.
(Same for nurses using Nurse Account)
